## 🧩 1. Introduction

Running a small business requires basic knowledge of economics to help you understand costs, pricing, profit, and how many units you must sell to reach your goals. This guide explains those fundamentals in simple language.

## 💰 2. Key Economic Terms (Simple Definitions)

### **1. Cost Price (CP)**

The amount of money spent to make or purchase one unit of product.

### **2. Selling Price (SP)**

The price at which you sell one unit.

### **3. Profit**

The money you earn after selling a product. **Formula:**

```
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
```

### **4. Profit Margin**

The percentage of profit you earn per product. **Formula:**

```
Profit Margin (%) = (Profit / Selling Price) × 100
```

### **5. Total Revenue (TR)**

Total money earned from all sales. **Formula:**

```
Total Revenue = Selling Price × Quantity Sold
```

### **6. Total Cost (TC)**

The total money spent to produce or buy all units. **Formula:**

```
Total Cost = Cost Price × Quantity Purchased
```

### **7. Net Profit**

The actual profit after subtracting all business expenses. **Formula:**

```
Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
```

### **8. Break-even Point (BEP)**

The point where your profit becomes zero (no loss, no profit). **Formula:**

```
Break-even Quantity = Fixed Cost / (Selling Price - Variable Cost)
```

### **9. Demand Forecasting**

Predicting how many units customers may buy per month.

---

## 📊 3. Basic Formulas You Must Know

### **A. Monthly Profit Calculation**

```
Monthly Profit = (SP - CP) × Quantity Sold - Other Expenses
```

### **B. Target Achievement Formula**

If your target is to earn a fixed amount:

```
Required Quantity = Target Profit / Profit Per Unit
```

### **C. Price Setting Formula (Simple)**

```
Selling Price = Cost Price + Desired Profit
```

## 📈 4. How to Predict Which Proposal to Take

When you have multiple business proposals (products, suppliers, or ideas), compare using **4 major criteria**:

### ✔️ **1. Cost Efficiency**

Choose the proposal with the **lowest cost price** and **lowest shipping**.

### ✔️ **2. Profit per Unit**

Choose the one giving the **highest profit**:

```
Profit Per Unit = SP - CP
```

### ✔️ **3. Demand Prediction**

Check which product people want more.

### ✔️ **4. Risk Level**

Lower risk = better decision.

---

## 📦 5. How Much Quantity You Must Sell to Reach Your Target

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Calculate Profit per Unit**

```
Profit per unit = SP - CP
```

2. **Determine Monthly Target** (example: 20,000 BDT)

3. **Apply Formula:**

```
Required Quantity = Monthly Target / Profit per Unit
```

4. **You get exactly how many units you must sell per month.**

### ✔ Example:

- Cost Price = 150 BDT
- Selling Price = 250 BDT
- Profit per unit = 100 BDT
- Monthly target = 20,000 BDT

```
Required Quantity = 20000 / 100 = 200 units per month
```

## 🧠 6. Simple Decision-Making Table

Use this table when selecting a product or supplier:

| Factor    | Weight | Your Rating (1-10) | Score (Weight × Rating) |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Cost      | 30%    |                    |                         |
| Profit    | 40%    |                    |                         |
| Demand    | 20%    |                    |                         |
| Risk      | 10%    |                    |                         |
| **Total** | 100%   |                    |                         |

Higher **Total Score** = Better Decision.
